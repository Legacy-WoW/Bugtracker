WoW-BugTracker

This is the unofficial/community issue tracker for the current versions of Â© World of Warcraft from Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. This project is run by players and meant to players. Although, it's public so Blizzard can, of course, have a look at. If you ever encounter a bug in the game, feel free to open an issue to let others know about it. You must fill correctly the template form in order to make your report valid.


How to create a good Bug Report?
If your bug report is effective, chances are higher that it will get fixed quickly. So fixing a bug depends on how effectively it's reported.

1) Reproducible:
If your bug is not reproducible it will be hard to fix it. You should clearly try to provide the steps to reproduce the bug. Do not assume or skip any reproducing step. A step-by-step description of the issue is easy to reproduce and therefore fix.

2) Specific:
Do not write an essay about the bug. Be specific and to the point. Try to summarize it in minimum words yet in effective way. Do not combine multiple bugs even if they seem to be similar. Write different reports for each bug.

3) Environment Details:
If your bug seems to be related to your setup, include some informations about it.
